# RDBMS
software that performs operation of CRUD, tabels, foriegn keys

-no data redundancy
data concurrecny
-data searching
-data integrity(numeric columns wont have alphabetic data )

Problems 
1. rigid schema
2. high cost
3. scalability issues (horisontal scaling / sharing is difficult)raph db

# Types of NoSql
1. Key Value (used for caching)
2. Document db (horizontal scaling)
3. Columnar db (colums are stored together in rows)
4. Graph db (majorly used for social networking websites) 


# Normalization
avoid redundancy

# Denormalization
- faster data read operations
- management convenience
- high data availiability
- reduces the number of etwork call to fetch data from multiple places.


Disadvantages: 
redundant data -> wastage of memory
it in creases the complexity
data incnsistency
it will cause slow write operations
