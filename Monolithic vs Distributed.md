# What is Monolithic Architecture?
Monolithic architecture is a software design methodology that combines all of an application's components into a single,
inseparable unit. Under this architecture, the user interface, business logic, and data access layers are all created, 
put into use, and maintained as one, unified unit.

# Distributed Architecture
-Alternative architectural approaches, like microservices, divide the application into smaller, separately deployable services.

# Monolithic Architecture VS Microservices(Distributed)
-Microservices are an architectural approach to developing software applications as a collection of small,
independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Instead of building a monolithic application 
where all the functionality is tightly integrated into a single codebase, microservices break down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services.

-Applications are divided into self-contained services, each focused on a specific function, simplifying development and maintenance.
Each microservice handles a particular business feature, like user authentication or product management, allowing for specialized development.
Services interact via APIs, facilitating standardized information exchange and integration.
Different technologies can be used for each service,
